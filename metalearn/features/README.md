##List of metafeatures generated by the produce function of the MetaFeatures class:


#Simple Metafeatures:

- classes - length of the set of possible values of the class
- attributes - number of attributes (not counting the class)
- numeric - number of numeric attributes
- nominal - number of nominal attributes
- numeric_rate - fraction of the attributes that are numeric
- nominal_rate - fraction of the attributes that are nominal
- dimensionality - number of attributes divided by number of samples
- samples - number of samples
- symbols_mean - mean of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_sd - standard deviation of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_min - min of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_max - max of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_sum - sum of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- class_prob_mean - mean of the rate of occurence of each class
- class_prob_sd - standard deviation of the rate of occurence of each class
- class_prob_min - min of the rate of occurence of each class
- class_prob_max - max of the rate of occurence of each class (equivalent to default accuracy)
- simple_time - time for simple metafeatures to be extracted
- total_time - time for all metafeatures to be extracted


#Statistical Metafeatures:

- skewness - mean of skewness calculated per attribute computed for each class
- skewness_prep - same as skewness except that the dataset's nominal attributes are one-hot encoded
- kurtosis - mean of kurtosis calculated per attribute per class
- kurtosis_prep - same as kurtosis except that the dataset's nominal attributes are one-hot encoded
- abs_cor - sum of correlation for each pair of attributes computed for each class (uses canonical correlation analysis)
- cancor_1 - cancor value 1 returned from canonical correlation analysis
- statistical_time - time for statistical metafeatures to be extracted


#Information Theoretic Metafeatures:

- class_entropy - entropy of the class
- normalized_class_entropy - entropy of the class divided by the natural log of the length of the set possible class values
- attribute_entropy - mean entropy of each attribute (numeric attributes are discretized into 9 bins)
- normalized_attribute_entropy - mean entropy of each attribute divided by the natural log of the length of the set of possible attribute values
- joint_entropy - mean of joint entropy between each attribute and the class
- mutual_information - mean of mutual information between each attribute and the class
- equivalent_information - class entropy divided by mutual information
- noise_signal_ratio - attribute entropy minus mutual information all over mutual information
- infotheo_time - time for information theoretic metafeatures to be extracted
