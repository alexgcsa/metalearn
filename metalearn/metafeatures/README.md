# Overview

All metafeatures should now implement Metafeature (from metafeatures.py), and the interface provided by the compute method.
The general idea is that we should be able to split metafeatures into as small of groups as makes sense, and extend this module so that it has a host of as many metafeatures as we find useful.

## List of metafeatures generated by the produce function of the MetaFeatures class:

# Simple Metafeatures:

- classes - length of the set of possible values of the class
- attributes - number of attributes (not counting the class)
- numeric - number of numeric attributes
- categorical - number of categorical attributes
- numeric_rate - fraction of the attributes that are numeric
- categorical_rate - fraction of the attributes that are categorical
- dimensionality - number of attributes divided by number of samples
- samples - number of samples
- symbols_mean - mean of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_sd - standard deviation of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_min - min of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_max - max of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- symbols_sum - sum of the length of the set of possible values for each attribute
- class_prob_mean - mean of the rate of occurence of each class
- class_prob_sd - standard deviation of the rate of occurence of each class
- class_prob_min - min of the rate of occurence of each class
- class_prob_max - max of the rate of occurence of each class (equivalent to default accuracy)
- simple_time - time for simple metafeatures to be extracted
- total_time - time for all metafeatures to be extracted


# Statistical Metafeatures:

- skewness - mean of skewness calculated per attribute computed for each class
- skewness_prep - same as skewness except that the dataset's categorical attributes are one-hot encoded
- kurtosis - mean of kurtosis calculated per attribute per class
- kurtosis_prep - same as kurtosis except that the dataset's categorical attributes are one-hot encoded
- abs_cor - sum of correlation for each pair of attributes computed for each class (uses canonical correlation analysis)
- cancor_1 - cancor value 1 returned from canonical correlation analysis
- statistical_time - time for statistical metafeatures to be extracted


# Information Theoretic Metafeatures:

- class_entropy - entropy of the class
- normalized_class_entropy - entropy of the class divided by the natural log of the length of the set possible class values
- attribute_entropy - mean entropy of each attribute (numeric attributes are discretized into 9 bins)
- normalized_attribute_entropy - mean entropy of each attribute divided by the natural log of the length of the set of possible attribute values
- joint_entropy - mean of joint entropy between each attribute and the class
- mutual_information - mean of mutual information between each attribute and the class
- equivalent_information - class entropy divided by mutual information
- noise_signal_ratio - attribute entropy minus mutual information all over mutual information
- infotheo_time - time for information theoretic metafeatures to be extracted
